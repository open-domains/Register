## Register a Domain

1. **Star** and **[Fork](https://github.com/open-domains/register/fork)**
2. Add a new file called `example.domain.json` in the `/domains` folder to register `example` subdomain
3. Edit it (below is just an **example**, provide a **valid** JSON file with your needs, the format is very strict; format you can [check here](https://jsonlint.com)):

```json
{
  "$schema": "../schemas/domain.schema.json",

  "description": "Project Description",

  "domain": "is-not-a.dev",
  "subdomain": "example",

  "owner": {
    "repo": "https://github.com/username/repo",
    "email": "hello@example.com"
  },

  "record": {
    "A": ["1.1.1.1", "1.0.0.1"],
    "AAAA": ["::1", "::2"],
    "CNAME": "example.com.",
    "MX": ["mx1.example.com.", "mx2.example.com."],
    "NS": ["ns1.example.com.", "ns2.example.com."],
    "TXT": ["example_verification=1234567890"]
  },

  "proxy": false
}
```
